Welcome to my blog, thanks for stopping by! I'm currently working as a System support analyst and have over five years experience in the field, with a degree to boot. Following on from my studies I'm always looking to learn and gain any experience possible when it comes to Cyber Security or Cloud technologies. Fueled by my willingness to persevere and determination to understand how things work the field of Cyber Security has piqued my interest not only as a hobby but also a potential career path. Look out for future posts where you can read more about what I'm getting up to, whether it's various HackTheBox walkthroughs, System Administration tips or the occasional DIY project! I'm always up for a challenge so feel free to get in touch; matt.wyatt@hotmail.co.uk
