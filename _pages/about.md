Welcome to my blog, thanks for stopping by! I'm Matt and I'm currently working as a Cyber Security Research analyst, looking to kick start my career in Cyber Security. I have over six years experience in a Networking and System Admin environment, in 2019 I graduated from the Uni of Roehampton with a first class honours in Digital Technology and Solutions. My degree and on the job exposure gave me a plethora of experience and solid platform to grow my skill set, I'm always looking to learn and grow, gaining any experience possible when it comes to Cyber Security or Cloud technologies. Fueled by my willingness to persevere and determination to understand how things work these two fields are where my main interests lie. 

Look out for future posts where you can read more about what I'm getting up to, whether it's various CTF walkthroughs, System Administration tips or the occasional DIY project! I'm always up for a challenge so feel free to get in touch; matt.wyatt@hotmail.co.uk
