What's that? You want to get started in CyberSecurity and persue a job in this amazing field? You have no idea how to get started? Well worry not! TryHackMe have recently released a new 'learning path' called Pre-Security to help people like you get started!

## TryHackMe
You may be asking, what is TryHackMe? What a great question. [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is a learning resource which focuses on CyberSecurity, they offer a wide range of courses from the very beginner fundamentals, all the way to complex simulated networks. They structure their learning in the forms of 'rooms' which focuses on a single concept or subject to help you understand the content. Alongside the learning content labs are provided to put what you've learnt into practice, helping cement the concepts and assist you to gain a full understanding of the topic. 

Better still, all this training can be carried out right from your browser! No need to install complex virtual machines or lab enviornments, you can simply launch an 'attack box' from your browser and hack and learn side by side! 

### Learning Paths
Rooms are combined to form learning paths, on TryHackMe's site there are a range of learning Paths, covering 'Offensive Pentesting', 'Web Fundamentals', 'Cyber Defense' and more! Upon completetion of a learning path students are awarded a certificate of completetion to be able to evidence their effort. Nice!

## Learning Path - Pre Security
The folks over at TryHackMe have just launched a new Pathway, ['Pre Security'](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity). This pathway is excellent for those new to the field or looking to gain an understanding of the core concepts before jumping into the field. The pathway covers everything you'd need to have a successful start in CyberSecurity. ![contents](/assets/images/TryHackMe/PreSec/coursecontents.png) 

If you're looking for something to get you started but you're fresh to the IT field then this is the pathway for you! What's more, from now until the 15th July there is a promotion where you can earn tickets for completing rooms within this pathway, complete 1 room and earn a ticket, collect 3 tickets that are the same and win a prize! What better reason do you need to get started?

## Conclusion
After working through this pathway and using TryHackMe for my own personal growth I can not recommend the platform enough! The Pre Security pathway is a great stepping stone for beginners to get their feet wet whilst providing enough depth to give you a solid foundation to build upon. If you manage to complete this pathway the learning doesn't stop there and TryHackMe are there to support you the whole way, providing a range of more technical rooms to sink your teeth into. I really enjoyed going through the pathway and found it even taught me a few things I didn't know before!
